-- How to run --
   1. Install Selenium and Firefox Gecko driver on your local machine
   2. Import the MercuryTour_Login_test1.java source
   3. Edit line #13 with the path to your installed Gecko Driver
   4. Run the test
   
-- Note --
This is just 1 test of possitive case, not a test suite with more cases as required because of time limitation (for me).
For login, we will have many more tests for other possitive cases, negative cases, validation, layout, initial displays, security, database... and each of these cases, we can create a test script.


Thanks!
